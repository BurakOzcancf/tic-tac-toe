## Overview

### What is the goal of this project?

I've made this game to make practice React.js skills and to build a project. So why the Tic Tac Toe game? Because building a Tic Tac Toe game is fun to develop and useful to improve frontend skills. Tic Tac Toe game already is a one of the most popular games.
